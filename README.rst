Clients
----
- To get started developing iOS apps that can generate insights from user data in a secure way, follow these `instructions <https://github.com/DiscreetAI/ios-library/blob/master/README.md>`_.

- If you want to play around with testing models by simply running a Google Colab notebook instead of deploying to a device, see `here <https://github.com/DiscreetAI/decentralized-ml/blob/master/datacenter/README.md>`_.

- To start developing models in Javascript, install our NPM library `here <https://github.com/DiscreetAI/decentralized-ml/blob/master/dml-library-js/README.md>`_.
